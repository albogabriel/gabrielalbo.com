<span class="category-description">NOTE:</span> The client's name, images and project details must remain private due to a non-disclosure agreement.

I have worked on the clientâ€™s e-com platform (ranked amongst U.S. top 5 biggest airlines) on their hotel booking and car rental modules. I have done mostly front-end development work, UX design and browser retro-compatibility work to accommodate their surprisingly big percentage of IE 6 and 7 users.

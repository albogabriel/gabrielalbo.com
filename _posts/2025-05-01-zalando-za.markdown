<div class="project-summary"> 
	<div class="category-description">CHALLENGE</div>
	<p>Scale Zalando’s GenAI assistant to drive user retention and high-value shopping actions (HVAs). My goal was to leverage LLMs to increase Monthly Active Users (MAU) and Discovery Repeat Sessions (DRS).</p>

	<div class="category-description">SOLUTION & ROLE</div>
	<p>Led design for three core workstreams, collaborating with Applied Science and Engineering to deliver:

	<ul>
		<li> <b>Desktop Outfit Building:</b> Translated mobile-first AI styling features to desktop.</li>
		<li> <b>Search Intent Integration:</b> Designed UI to infer customer intent during search for more relevant, personalized results.</li>
	    <li> <b>Streaming Experience:</b> Optimized perceived latency by designing a progressive response UI, delivering value faster.</li>
	</ul>
    </p>
	
	<div class="category-description">MY ROLE</div>
	<p>I have lead design work on those fronts, collaborating with Product Management, Applied Sciences, Engineering and fellow Designers on the creation of solutions that would solve the customer problems in elegant and technically feasible ways and drive more learning for the team based on usage data.</p>
	
	<div class="category-description">APPROACH</div>
	<p>Worked in high-velocity, multidisciplinary sprints to launch A/B experiments ahead of peak traffic seasons, ensuring solutions were both technically feasible and seamlessly integrated.</p>

	<div class="category-description">RESULTS</div>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li> User Growth: Surpassed internal targets, <b>impacting initial MAU by over 135%</b>.</li>
		<li> Engagement: Significantly increased HVAs (Add to Cart/Wishlist) and repeat discovery sessions.</li>
		<li> Impact: Improved conversion, lowered return rates, and secured increased internal investment for the product.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

As part of the Personalization, Recommendations, Search and Browse (PRSB) team, I contributed with the growth of the Zalando Assistant (ZA), an AI-powered, conversational chatbot that provides personalized fashion advice and product recommendations. 

I have worked specifically on features such as Outfit building, Search Results Integration and Streaming Experience, collaborating with Engineering, Product managers, Applied Scientist and fellow designers on creating solutions that have driven high customer value and business impact, significantly increasing customer engagement with ZA and helping surpass internal growth projections by a high margin.

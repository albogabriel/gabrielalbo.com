	<div class="category-description">CHALLENGE</div>
	<p>The Zalando Assistant (ZA) is a generative AI-powered shopping companion designed to help you navigate Zalando’s massive fashion catalog using natural language. I have joined the ZA team as a Product Designer to work on different new features with the goals of helping increase the number of Monthly Active Users (MAU) of ZA, increasing High Valuable Actions (HVAs) - such as having suggested products wishlisted and added to the shopping cart - and increasing Discovery Repeat Session (DRS). Above all, the main goal was to generally improve Zalando customer experiences using the LLMs capabilities.</p>

	<div class="category-description">SOLUTION</div>
	<p>Among the solutions we have envisioned to help us achieve those goals, I have worked directly on features such as:
	* Desktop designs for outfit building - translating the mobile experience of having ZA build outfits with items that match a particular item the customer requests for.
	* Search Results Integration - Inferring customer intent during a regular search to provide better results that would match what they were looking for. 
	* Streaming Experience - Making ZA's responses render progressively, minimizing the latency of server requests and delivering valuable information for customers faster.</p>
	
	<div class="category-description">MY ROLE</div>
	<p>I have lead design work on those fronts, collaborating with Product Management, Applied Sciences, Engineering and fellow Designers on the creation of solutions that would solve the customer problems in elegant and technically feasible ways and drive more learning for the team based on usage data.</p>
	
	<div class="category-description">APPROACH</div>
	<p>With high multidisciplinary collaboration, we have come up with solutions that seamlessly integrated to Zalando's ecosystem in a feasible timeline (so we could launch them as A/B experiments in time for the higher traffic periods of the year) to be able to analyze user actions and adapt on the go.</p>

	<div class="category-description">RESULTS</div>
	<p>Between the beginning of such work and the end of the experiement phase, we have successfully reached all internal product goals, increasing HVAs and DRSs significantly and surpassing the internal goal of number of Monthly Active Users, nearly doubling the initial number. Such achievements helped increase customer satisfaction, drive higher conversion and lower return rates and allowed the product to gain even more traction for internal investment for the near future.</p>

As part of the Personalization, Recommendations, Search and Browse (PRSB) team, I contributed with the growth of the Zalando Assistant (ZA), an AI-powered, conversational chatbot that provides personalized fashion advice and product recommendations. 

I have worked specifically on features such as Outfit building, Search Results Integration and Streaming Experience, collaborating with Engineering, Product managers, Applied Scientist and fellow designers on creating solutions that have driven high customer value and business impact, significantly increasing customer engagement with ZA and helping surpass internal growth projections by a high margin.

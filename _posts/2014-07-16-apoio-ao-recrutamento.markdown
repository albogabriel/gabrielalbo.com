This was a Thoughtworks internal initiative aiming to support a redesign of the recruitment processes in Brazil, which were going through difficulties regarding its length, quantitative and qualitative results. A Service Design approach was used, including research, prototyping and experimentation through close collaboration with recruiters.

There was a measurable improvement in process lengths in the different phases (CV screening, phone screening, interviewing and hiring decision processes) and a noticeable improvement regarding recruiting team happiness and candidate experience.

As part of an agile team at Thoughtworks I helped build a internal system for the biggest hospital in Haiti. I was responsible for user research, interaction design, visual design and frontend development.

The hospital provides primary care services to about 185,000 people in Mirebalais and two nearby communities. But patients from a much wider area—all of central Haiti and areas in and around Port-au-Prince—can also receive secondary and tertiary care. The hospital sees as many as 700 patients every day in our ambulatory clinics.

The system needed to be intuitive and easy to use, it was going to be used by people from Haiti with low experience with computers and used to keyboards. So it was a challange to build something that fit their needs and experience.

During a visit to the hospital facilities in Haiti, [Bill Gates himself called it "(...) a sophisticated system for keeping medical records"](http://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/A-Visit-to-Haiti). :)

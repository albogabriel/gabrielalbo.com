I worked for Payback as a UX designer for one year. During that time, a multifunctional team and I worked on designing and delivering the concept of (Marketing) Challenges for Payback. We developed a desktop admin system that allowed Payback marketing managers to create challenges (such as “Every 50€ spent on Store X during the month of December grants you a 20% discount coupon”) and a user interface on the Payback app so customers could enroll in challenges and track their progress.

My work focused, but was not limited to, running an inception with over 20 participants from the team and stakeholders to frame the product. I conducted user research and analysis, created prototypes for testing, designed the user interfaces, and collaborated with the development team to find agile solutions for front-end framework capabilities.

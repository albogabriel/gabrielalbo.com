    <div class="category-description">CHALLENGE</div>
    <p>Mercedes-Benz needed a centralized portal to integrate multiple development teams and their delivery pipelines within the MIC (Mercedes-Benz Intelligent Cloud), ensuring seamless collaboration and process alignment.</p>

    <div class="category-description">SOLUTION</div>
    <p>A unified MIC Portal that streamlined project dependencies, improved information flow, and provided an organized interface for managing development processes within MB.OS.</p>
    
    <div class="category-description">MY ROLE</div>
    <p>Conducted research across different workstreams, defined the portalâ€™s information architecture, and designed the user interface. Worked closely with teams to ensure integration across all streams.</p>
    
    <div class="category-description">APPROACH</div>
    <p>Facilitated workshops to map user needs and workflows, refined taxonomy and logical structures, and iteratively designed the portal to enhance usability. Paired with developers to align design with implementation.</p>

    <div class="category-description">RESULTS</div>
    <p>Delivered a scalable MIC Portal that improved team collaboration, streamlined development workflows, and ensured a more structured integration of projects within the MB.OS ecosystem.</p>

I worked as a UX designer for one year in the MIC Portal Team. The MIC (Mercedes-Benz Intelligent Cloud) offers a reliable infrastructure, various frameworks, functions, processes, policies, and applications for connected cars and the MB.OS (Mercedes-Benz Operating System) functions.

The MIC Portal Team and I designed and developed a portal that integrates multiple development teams and their different delivery pipelines. We conducted comprehensive research across all the different streams of work and worked in detail on information architecture to establish an accurate taxonomy and logical flow for how processes should integrate and how dependencies between different projects should be handled. I helped design and develop the portal itself and integrated all work streams within it.

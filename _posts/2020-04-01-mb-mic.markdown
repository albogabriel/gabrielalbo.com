I worked as a UX designer for one year in the MIC Portal Team. The MIC (Mercedes-Benz Intelligent Cloud) offers a reliable infrastructure, various frameworks, functions, processes, policies, and applications for connected cars and the MB.OS (Mercedes-Benz Operating System) functions.

The MIC Portal Team and I designed and developed a portal that integrates multiple development teams and their different delivery pipelines. We conducted comprehensive research across all the different streams of work and worked in detail on information architecture to establish an accurate taxonomy and logical flow for how processes should integrate and how dependencies between different projects should be handled. I helped design and develop the portal itself and integrated all work streams within it.
